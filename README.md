# dayPlannerHW
UCF Coding Bootcamp Homework assignment. 
This project was styled with css, layed out with html, and the functionality was made possible with JavaScript, and a small Js library called moment.js

This allows someone to save messages for their daily plans based on the hours of the work days. The colors of the boxes change based on if its present, past, or upcoming. Finally it can also be saved so that when you come back to the page it will be ready to read. Also the top features a clock that is current, and will give you an indicator of if its present, past, or current.
